# METDataPoint
Python code to request data from MET Data Point (https://www.metoffice.gov.uk/services/data/datapoint) 


You'll need to generate an API here: https://www.metoffice.gov.uk/services/data/datapoint/api

Then add this to the relevant files.

Then in the METDailyPull.py you can input the longitude and latitude of areas you want to find the nearest weather station to, it will then output a 5-day forecast from these weather stations to your desktop as a .csv. 

You can set this to either merge with the pre-existing .csv, choose to output only a one 5-day period .csv and also have multiple sites.
